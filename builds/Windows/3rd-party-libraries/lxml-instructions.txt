Distributing a working lxml with embedded Python is tedious. Often errors of the type
	ImportError: cannot import name 'etree' from 'lxml'
are thrown.

The reason is that lxml wraps C libraries that are compiled for a certain processor architecture;
and these pre-compiled artefacts are missing when using the source distributions.

One can use the corresponding whl package from
	https://pypi.org/project/lxml/#files
which ships with the respective pre-compiled artefacts instead of C sources.

The lxml wheel version must be the one pre-compiled for the used embedded Python version.
The target Python platform is encoded in the name of the pre-compiled artefacts, e.g.,
	etree.cp39-win_amd64.pyd
is for Python 3.9, Windows x64.

The lxml zip-bundle here (the "lxml-*.zip" file) is manually constructed from such a wheel
(the "lxml-*.whl" file).
