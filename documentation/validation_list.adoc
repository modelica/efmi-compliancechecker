== Compliance Checker validation list

The compliance checker aims to validate the content of the provided eFMU folder (with regards to the Algorithm Code model representation) against a number of rules which are described in the specification document, in addition to checking the consistency of all model representation manifest files. The items to be validated are listed in the sections below. The provided tables also provide a brief description for each checked element in addition to
the item reference in the specification document and the location in the code of the compliance checker. 
//Moreover, the attributes/sub-elements of an element are expressed by adding a "{plus}" sign, also "{plus}{plus}" added for the attributes of a sub-element.

==== Checking the eFMU container architecture

The checking carried out by the compliance checker includes:

- Checking if the provided file is a valid fmu archive
- Finding the eFMU folder in the archive, which is a requirement by the specification document
- Finding the __content.xml file in the eFMU folder
- Locating the schemas folder in the eFMU folder

==== Retrieving data from the parsed __content.xml file

After parsing the __content.xml file the following data (attributes) can be extracted for each included model representation

- The kind (AlgorithmCode, EquationCode, ...)
- The name which represents the name of the folder to store all files of the model representation
- The manifest attribute which serves as the manifest file name for the model representation
- The checksum of the manifest file
- The manifestRefId which represents the id of the manifest file

- parsing each algorithm code file, this also includes retrieving and storing the content (variables declarations and functions)

- validating all variables: checking if all variables listed in the xml manifest file are also declared
    in the alg file. Also checking if declared variables in the alg file are listed in the xml file. Moreover, it
    checks if variables types and causalities in the xml file match types and causalities in the alg file
