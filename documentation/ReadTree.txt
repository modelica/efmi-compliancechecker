        Class ReadTree inherited from the Lark.Transformer class so it is able to visit each node of the tree.
        
        This class uses methods that have the same names of visited rules, for example: The function_declaration method in this class is invoked
        automatically when the node (rule) function_declaration is encountered in the tree.

        Methods which start by __ in the name are called locally only, for example: the __single_assignment method below is not called automatically,
        it is instead called by other methods of the ReadTree class only.
